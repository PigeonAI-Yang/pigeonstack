> Codex host: Read [../../CODEX.md](../../CODEX.md) before execution. The Primary works directly by default. Invoke subagents only when the user explicitly requests them for this task. Upstream delegation steps and skill selection grant no permission. Resolve authorized models and efforts through [../../MODELS.md](../../MODELS.md).

# Swarm

## Start

Open a todolist with one entry per phase before launching anything.

1. Frame
2. Fan out
3. Aggregate
4. Report

## Phase A: Frame

1. State the done predicate and the artifact or report the swarm must return.
2. Choose the shape. Partition into slices, race N workers on identical briefs, or mix both. For a race or mixed shape, declare `first pass`, `rank all`, or `best-of` before spawning.
3. Set N from the user or derive it from the shape. N is total workers, not the cloud concurrency limit.
4. Resolve `swarm workers` through `MODELS.md`. Default ordinary worker assignments to Sol. Give Luna only simple repetitive mechanical work with a fixed-step brief; do not split coherent Sol work into Luna microtasks. For an explicitly selected race, name each supported model and effort up front; a rejected required model blocks that arm without substitution.
5. Give each worker its own writable output when it writes. When workers verify or measure commits, each brief names the exact SHAs. A measurement brief also names the method (sample count, what one sample is, order). The worker records both in its result.

## Phase B: Fan out

When the user explicitly authorizes parallel agents, dispatch the selected workers through CODEX.md using the model and effort resolved in step 4. Use actual host arguments. Cloud environments and implicit parent inheritance are not available through an invented tool field.

When a worker must start from a non-default pushed branch, pass `cloud_base_branch`.

Every brief stands alone. Include the goal, scope, exact slice or race arm, how to verify, and what to report. Reports use `PASS`, `ISSUES`, or `BLOCKED` with evidence. A worker that can prove a defect reports `ISSUES` and lists every issue it can prove, not only the first.

If a worker drops out, proceed with N-1 and note it.

## Phase C: Aggregate

Read the terminal results. Drop a result that does not record the SHAs and method its brief names, and respawn that worker once. After a second miss, record a gap. A gap does not count as a pass. For coverage, every required slice needs a result. For a race, apply the selection rule declared up front. Use first pass, rank all, or best-of. Do not paste raw worker dumps.

## Phase D: Report

Return one consolidated in-chat report with a result table, issue one-liners, gaps or dropouts, and the race rule when used.
